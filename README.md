## Overview

The **Landscape Line Intercept (LLI)** is a landscape connectivity metric that reinterprets
the borders of a regular hexagonal grid as a spatially exhaustive set of systematic
transects — directly analogous to the line intercept method in vegetation ecology
(Canfield 1941). The proportion of each cell perimeter that intersects natural habitat
defines the LLI, providing a measure of **interface connectivity** complementary to
within-cell area metrics.

**Key distinction:** Area sampling (polygon interior) and line sampling (polygon
perimeter) are complementary estimators of landscape structure. Area estimates
*composition* (what is inside a cell); LLI estimates *interface connectivity* (how
permeable the cell boundary is to habitat continuity with neighbouring units). Their
joint distribution characterises landscape state more fully than either alone.

**Methodological lineage:** The LLI extends line intersect sampling (LIS; Ramezani &
Holm 2011) from an external probabilistic sampling strategy to an intrinsic, exhaustive
analytical structure. Rather than imposing transects externally to reduce data-collection
cost, the LLI treats the boundaries of a regular grid — already present in any grid-based
workflow — as a spatially exhaustive set of transects. Every boundary pixel is counted,
not sampled.

**Study domain:** Fixed rectangle of 1,500 × 1,500 km in central Brazil
(ESRI:102033 South America Albers Equal Area Conic), encompassing the core Cerrado,
southern Amazon arc of deforestation, northern Pantanal, and Cerrado–Caatinga
transition zone (~2.25 × 10⁶ km²).

**Input data:** MapBiomas Collection 10.1 binary rasters (natural vegetation vs.
non-natural land cover), 30 m resolution, 1985–2024 (annual). Effective analysis
period: **1986–2023** (38 years; boundary years excluded due to MapBiomas temporal
filtering artefacts).

**Primary grid:** Regular hexagonal, 20,000 ha (side ≈ 8.77 km; perimeter ≈ 52.6 km;
flat-to-flat width ≈ 15.2 km), 11,500 cells.

**Naming note:** the metric was originally called the *Edge Interception Index (EII)*.
Data files, column names and notebook code still use the legacy prefix `eii_`;
throughout this repository, `eii` = LLI.

## Conceptual basis

For each cell *i* at time *t*, two metrics are computed:

**Within-cell area** — proportion of natural habitat pixels inside the cell:

$$A_i(t) = \frac{\sum_{p \in C_i} \mathbf{1}[r_p(t) = 1]}{|C_i|}$$

**Landscape Line Intercept** — proportion of the cell perimeter intercepting natural
habitat:

$$w_i(t) = \frac{L_i^{\text{nat}}(t)}{P_i^{\text{obs}}(t)}$$

where $L_i^{\text{nat}}(t)$ is the count of perimeter pixels intercepting natural habitat
(value = 1), and $P_i^{\text{obs}}(t)$ is the total count of valid perimeter pixels
(nodata = 255 excluded).

**Compositional–configurational divergence** — signed difference between interface
connectivity and interior composition:

$$\delta_i(t) = w_i(t) - A_i(t)$$

- $\delta > 0$: interface more connected than interior composition suggests
- $\delta < 0$: interface more degraded than interior composition suggests
- $\delta \approx 0$: the two dimensions are aligned

**Four landscape states** in the Area × LLI space (threshold τ = 0.5):

| State | Area | LLI | Landscape interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Concordant-High | ≥ 0.5 | ≥ 0.5 | Intact: abundant interior habitat, connected interface |
| Concordant-Low | < 0.5 | < 0.5 | Degraded: scarce interior, isolated interface |
| Type I | ≥ 0.5 | < 0.5 | Interior preserved, interface already degraded |
| Type II | < 0.5 | ≥ 0.5 | Interior largely lost, interface connectivity persists |

Type I and Type II cells are the *compositionally–configurationally divergent* states:
landscapes where area metrics alone would misrepresent connectivity status.

## Key results (effective analysis period 1986–2023)

**RQ1 — Informational complementarity:**
- Pearson r between LLI and Area: 0.960–0.966 across all 38 years (stable but not
  redundant: ~7% unexplained variance corresponds to ~800 cells/year where LLI
  carries independent structural information)
- Proportion of cells where |residual| > 0.10 (LLI substantially exceeds area
  prediction): doubled from **8.0% (1986) to 16.4% (2023)**
- Divergent cells (Type I + II combined): tripled from **2.8% (1986) to 8.2% (2023)**
- Spatial clustering of divergence: Moran's I = 0.094–0.136, significant in all
  38 years (p < 0.01, 99 permutations)

**RQ2 — Spatiotemporal divergence dynamics:**
- Concordant-High cells: 90.8% → 58.4% (−32.4 pp over 38 years)
- Negative tail of δ widened: P10 from −0.060 (1986) to −0.094 (2023); proportion
  of cells with δ < 0 increased from 41.7% to 47.0%
- Domain-level Pettitt test (series of first differences): single significant
  transition in rate of LLI decline detected in **2006** (K = 346, p < 0.001),
  coinciding with PPCDAm consolidation and Soy Moratorium — detected without
  auxiliary governance information
- Cell-level heterochrony (Mode A): primary break years span 1990–2020
  (median: 2000; SD: 6.0 years), documenting the progressive advance of the
  deforestation frontier across the domain

**RQ3 — MAUP sensitivity:**
- Zoning effect: mean domain-level LLI varies < 0.005 across 25 systematic grid
  realisations; **CV < 0.003**
- Scale effect: mean LLI difference < 0.001 across HEX-10, HEX-20, HEX-40
  (10,000–40,000 ha range)
- Shape effect: maximum cell-wise difference < 0.008 between HEX-20 and SQ-20
  across all quadrants of the 5×5 Area × LLI frequency matrix

## Getting started

### Requirements

Python >= 3.10. Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Package versions are not pinned yet (see `requirements.txt`).

### Critical note on nodata encoding

MapBiomas binary rasters declare `nodata=0` in file metadata, but `0` encodes
non-natural vegetation — a valid value that **must** be counted in the denominator.
True outside-domain pixels are encoded as `255`. All analysis notebooks (phase1–phase3)
use `nodata=255` hardcoded. Do not override this without verifying the raster encoding.
**Exception:** the legacy `continuidade_refatorado.ipynb` reads nodata from the raster
metadata and must not be used on MapBiomas rasters without changing this. See Methods
Section 3.2 of the companion manuscript for full details.

### Running the pipeline

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `config/config_template.py` to `config/config_local.py` (git-ignored) and edit paths
3. Open notebooks in order:
   - `jitter_grid_generation` → generates 25 displacement realisations for RQ3
   - `phase1_sensitivity_analysis_v21` → MAUP sensitivity (shape, scale, zoning)
   - `phase2_annual_pipeline` → extracts annual LLI and Area; states, Moran's I, δ
   - `phase3_closing_analyses` → correlation, residuals, 5×5 matrices
   - `phase3_changepoint_detection` → cell-level change points (heterochrony)
   - `phase3_segment_decomposition` → per-segment LLI and directional metrics
4. Edit **only the configuration cell** (Section 1) in each notebook, using the
   values from your `config_local.py`
5. Run all cells sequentially — the checkpoint system allows safe interruption
   and resumption without reprocessing completed years
