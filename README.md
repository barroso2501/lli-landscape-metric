## Overview

The **Landscape Line Intercept (LLI)** is a landscape connectivity metric that reinterprets
the borders of a regular hexagonal grid as a spatially exhaustive set of systematic
transects — directly analogous to the line intercept method in vegetation ecology
(Canfield 1941). The proportion of each cell perimeter that intersects natural habitat
defines the EII, providing a measure of **interface connectivity** complementary to
within-cell area metrics.

**Key distinction:** Area sampling (polygon interior) and line sampling (polygon
perimeter) are complementary estimators of landscape structure. Area estimates
*composition* (what is inside a cell); EII estimates *interface connectivity* (how
permeable the cell boundary is). Their joint distribution characterizes landscape
state more fully than either alone.

**Study domain:** Fixed rectangle of 1,500 × 1,500 km in central Brazil
(ESRI:102033 Albers Equal Area Conic), encompassing the core Cerrado, southern Amazon
deforestation frontier, northern Pantanal, and Cerrado–Caatinga transition zone.

**Input data:** MapBiomas binary rasters (natural vegetation vs. non-natural), 30 m
resolution, 1985–2024 (annual)

**Primary grid:** Hexagonal, 20,000 ha (~15.2 km side), 11,500 cells

## Conceptual basis

For each cell *i* at time *t*, two metrics are computed:

**Within-cell area** — proportion of natural habitat pixels inside the cell:

$$A_i(t) = \frac{\sum_{p \in C_i} \mathbf{1}[r_p(t) = 1]}{|C_i|}$$

**Edge Interception Index** — proportion of the cell perimeter intercepting natural
habitat:

$$w_i(t) = \frac{L_i^{\text{nat}}(t)}{P_i^{\text{obs}}(t)}$$

**Continuous divergence** — difference between interface connectivity and interior
composition:

$$\delta_i(t) = w_i(t) - A_i(t)$$

$\delta > 0$: interface more connected than interior composition suggests
$\delta < 0$: interface more degraded than interior composition suggests

The four landscape states in the Area × EII space:

| State | Area | EII | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coupled-High | High | High | Intact: abundant interior habitat, connected interface |
| Coupled-Low | Low | Low | Degraded: scarce interior habitat, isolated interface |
| Type I | High | Low | Interior preserved, interface degraded |
| Type II | Low | High | Interior lost, interface still connected |

## Key results (Phases 1–2 complete)

**Grid configuration sensitivity (Phase 1):**
- EII estimates are robust to grid placement: mean range < 0.005 across 25 jitter
  realizations; CV < 0.003
- Scale effect negligible: mean EII differs < 0.001 across 10,000 / 20,000 / 40,000 ha
- Shape effect negligible at biome scale: HEX-20 and SQ-20 distributions differ < 0.008

**Annual time series 1985–2024 (Phase 2):**
- EII mean declined from 0.858 (1985) to 0.643 (2024); Area mean from 0.859 to 0.644
- Coupled-High cells: 91.5% → 57.6% (−33.9 pp over 40 years)
- Divergent cells (Type I + II): 2.5% → 8.4%; spatially clustered in all years
  (Moran's I = 0.094–0.136, p < 0.01 throughout)
- Negative tail of δ widened: P10 from −0.061 to −0.093; % cells with |δ| < 0.05
  fell from 75.8% to 58.5%

## Getting started

### Requirements

```
Python >= 3.10
rasterstats
geopandas
rasterio
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
libpysal
esda
```

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install rasterstats geopandas rasterio pandas numpy matplotlib libpysal esda
```

### Critical note on nodata encoding

MapBiomas binary rasters declare `nodata=0` in file metadata, but `0` encodes
non-natural vegetation — a valid value that must be counted in the denominator.
True outside-domain pixels are encoded as `255`. All notebooks use `nodata=255`
hardcoded. Do not override this without verifying the raster encoding.

### Running the pipeline

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `config/config_template.py` and edit paths
3. Open notebooks in order: `continuidade_refatorado` → `jitter_grid_generation`
   → `phase1_sensitivity_analysis_v2` → `phase2_annual_pipeline`
4. Edit only the configuration cell (Section 1) in each notebook
5. Run all cells sequentially — checkpoint system allows safe interruption and
   resumption
