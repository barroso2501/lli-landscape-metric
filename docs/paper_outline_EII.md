## Proposed Title

*"The Edge Interception Index: a systematic transect-based metric for landscape interface connectivity and its application to four decades of habitat dynamics in the Brazilian Cerrado"*

---

## Research Questions

**RQ1.** Does the Edge Interception Index (EII) capture the interface connectivity dimension of landscape configuration in ways not accessible to within-cell area metrics alone?

**RQ2.** How do Area and EII diverge in space and time across the study domain, and what landscape processes drive compositional-configurational divergence?

**RQ3.** How robust are EII estimates to grid configuration choices (shape, scale, and placement), and how sensitive are temporal patterns to the choice of sampling interval?

---

## Terminology note

Throughout this document, the term **"compositional-configurational divergence"** replaces earlier uses of "decoupling." Area and EII measure fundamentally distinct dimensions of landscape structure — composition (what is inside a cell) and interface connectivity (how permeable the cell boundary is). Divergence between them is not an anomaly but an informative signal about landscape state. The four quadrants of the Area × EII space are named accordingly:

| Quadrant | Area | EII | Landscape interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coupled-High | High | High | Intact: abundant interior habitat, connected interface |
| Coupled-Low | Low | Low | Degraded: scarce interior habitat, isolated interface |
| Type I | High | Low | Interior preserved, interface degraded |
| Type II | Low | High | Interior lost, interface still connected |

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Opening problem
- Area-based metrics (proportion of natural habitat within spatial units) are the dominant tool for landscape monitoring at regional scales.
- Area captures landscape composition but not interface connectivity: two cells with identical area proportions can differ fundamentally in how habitat is distributed relative to their boundaries.
- This distinction matters ecologically: habitat permeability at unit boundaries governs dispersal and movement, while interior composition determines local habitat quality. Neither dimension alone fully characterizes landscape state.

### 1.2 Existing approaches and their limitations
- FRAGSTATS-based metrics (patch area, edge density, shape indices): computed internally to each unit; do not measure cross-boundary permeability at the landscape scale.
- Graph-based connectivity models (circuit theory, least-cost paths): powerful but computationally intensive, require species-specific parameterization, and do not scale easily to biome-wide annual time series.
- Linear transect methods in vegetation ecology (Canfield 1941; Levy & Madden 1933): well-established estimators of cover based on systematic line sampling; not previously applied at landscape scale to raster time series.

### 1.3 The proposed approach
- We propose reinterpreting the borders of a regular hexagonal grid as a spatially exhaustive set of systematic transects — directly analogous to the line intercept method of vegetation ecology.
- Each border segment between adjacent cells constitutes a linear transect; the proportion of the segment intercepting natural habitat defines the Edge Interception Index (EII).
- This transposition from vegetation ecology to landscape ecology provides a conceptually grounded, computationally efficient, and temporally replicable metric of interface connectivity.
- The hexagonal grid is particularly suited to this approach: six sides per cell sample six directions, providing greater directional isotropy than square grids (four sides, axial bias).
- Area sampling (polygon interior) and line sampling (polygon perimeter) are complementary estimators: the former estimates composition, the latter estimates interface connectivity. Their joint distribution characterizes landscape state more fully than either alone.

### 1.4 Study area and motivation
- A fixed rectangular domain of 1,500 × 1,500 km in central Brazil, encompassing the core Cerrado, the southern Amazon deforestation frontier, the northern Pantanal, and the Cerrado–Caatinga transition zone.
- The domain covers the full gradient of land-use intensity documented in central Brazil over the study period — from consolidated agricultural areas in the north (MATOPIBA) to more preserved savannas in the center and south.
- MapBiomas annual binary rasters (natural vs. non-natural vegetation, 30 m resolution, 1985–2024) provide the input data.

### 1.5 Research questions
*(State RQ1, RQ2, RQ3 as formalized above.)*

### 1.6 Contributions
1. A formal transect-based metric of landscape interface connectivity derived from regular hexagonal grids, grounded in the line intercept sampling theory of vegetation ecology.
2. A demonstration that Area and EII capture distinct, complementary dimensions of landscape structure — composition and interface connectivity respectively — and that their divergence is ecologically informative and spatially structured.
3. A systematic treatment of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) as quantifiable sampling variance rather than an unavoidable limitation.

---

## 2. Background

### 2.1 The line intercept method in vegetation ecology
- Canfield (1941): foundational formulation of line intercept sampling for cover estimation.
- Statistical properties: unbiased estimator of cover under random or systematic placement.
- Transposition to landscape scale: border segments as systematic, spatially exhaustive transects. The grid is not merely a spatial partition but a sampling device.

### 2.2 Composition vs. configuration in landscape ecology
- McGarigal & Marks (1995): foundational distinction between landscape composition (what is present) and configuration (how it is arranged spatially).
- Area metrics capture composition. EII captures configuration at the interface level.
- Gap: no existing metric simultaneously captures (a) systematic spatial coverage, (b) temporal replicability at annual resolution, and (c) interface-level configuration.

### 2.3 The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem in landscape ecology
- Classical MAUP: scale effect and zoning effect.
- Existing treatments: typically acknowledged as a caveat, rarely quantified.
- Reframing: when the grid is treated as a sampling device, MAUP becomes sampling variance — a quantity that can be estimated and reported.

## 3. Methods

### 3.1 Study area
- The study domain is a fixed rectangular area of 1,500 × 1,500 km (2.25 × 10⁶ km²) in the South America Albers Equal Area Conic projection (ESRI:102033; central meridian −60°W; standard parallels −5° and −42°; datum SAD69).
- Domain coordinates (projected): lower-left (200,000; 1,700,000) m — upper-right (1,700,000; 3,200,000) m.
- The domain encompasses: the core Brazilian Cerrado; the southern Amazon deforestation frontier (arc of deforestation); the northern Pantanal; and the Cerrado–Caatinga transition zone.
- A fixed rectangular domain was deliberately chosen to ensure all grid cells are geometrically complete across all tested configurations, eliminating clipping-induced confounding from boundary irregularities.
- Ecological justification: the domain covers the full gradient of land-use intensity documented in central Brazil over the study period — from consolidated agricultural areas in the north (MATOPIBA region) to more preserved savannas in the center and south — providing the landscape configuration diversity required for a rigorous methodological evaluation.
- All input raster data (MapBiomas, 1985–2024) provide complete coverage of the domain.

### 3.2 Input data
- MapBiomas Collection [X], 30 m resolution, 1985–2024.
- Binarization: natural vegetation (value 1) vs. non-natural (value 0); outside-domain pixels encoded as 255 (nodata).
- Annual time series: 40 raster layers.
- **Technical note on nodata encoding:** raster metadata declares nodata=0, but 0 = non-natural vegetation (valid data). All EII and Area calculations use nodata=255 to correctly include non-natural pixels in the denominator.
- Rationale for binary classification: focus on habitat presence/absence rather than vegetation type diversity.

### 3.3 Grid design

**Projection and domain:**
- All grids generated in ESRI:102033 (South America Albers Equal Area Conic), ensuring equal-area cells throughout the domain.
- Grid extent: the 1,500 × 1,500 km rectangular domain. All cells fully contained within the domain — no boundary clipping applied.

**Primary configuration — hexagonal grid, 20,000 ha:**
- Cell area: 20,000 ha (200 km²); side length: ~15.2 km; diagonal: ~26.2 km; actual cells: 11,500.
- Rationale for hexagonal geometry: six border segments at 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300° provide near-isotropic directional sampling, compared to four segments at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° for square grids.
- Rationale for 20,000 ha as primary scale: (1) ecologically interpretable as the watershed / small-municipality scale; (2) perimeter length (~54 km) provides sufficient pixel contacts for estimator stability; (3) alignment with territorial planning scales commonly used in Brazilian conservation policy.

**Scale sensitivity configurations:**

| Configuration | Cell area | Side length | Actual cells | Ecological scale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fine | 10,000 ha | ~10.7 km | 22,842 | Property / forest fragment |
| **Primary** | **20,000 ha** | **~15.2 km** | **11,500** | **Watershed / small municipality** |
| Coarse | 40,000 ha | ~21.5 km | 5,822 | Regional mosaic / corridor |

- Scale ratio: ×2 in side length, ×4 in area between consecutive levels.
- Hexagonal grids do not nest perfectly across scales; scale comparisons are treated as independent configurations.

**Shape sensitivity configuration — square grid:**
- Cell area: 20,000 ha; side length: ~14.1 km; actual cells: 11,449.
- Note: equal area implies unequal perimeter (P_square ≈ 56.6 km vs. P_hexagon ≈ 54.4 km); reported explicitly (see Section 3.7.1).

### 3.4 EII formalization

**Within-cell area metric (composition):**

$$A_i(t) = \frac{\sum_{p \in C_i} \mathbf{1}[r_p(t) = 1]}{|C_i|}$$

where $C_i$ is the set of valid pixels within cell $i$, $r_p(t)$ is the binary raster value of pixel $p$ at time $t$, and $|C_i|$ is the total count of valid pixels. Computed using `zonal_stats` with `stats=['count','sum']` on polygon interiors (`all_touched=False`).

**Edge Interception Index (interface connectivity):**

$$w_i(t) = \frac{L_i^{\text{nat}}(t)}{P_i^{\text{obs}}(t)}$$

where $L_i^{\text{nat}}(t)$ is the count of perimeter pixels intercepting natural habitat at time $t$, and $P_i^{\text{obs}}(t)$ is the total count of valid perimeter pixels. Computed using `zonal_stats` with `categorical=True`, `all_touched=True` on perimeter (boundary) geometries.

Both metrics $\in [0, 1]$.

**Connection to the line intercept method:**
- Each of the six hexagonal border segments constitutes a systematic transect.
- Each pixel contact with natural habitat is a "hit."
- $w_i(t)$ is the hit rate along the perimeter transect — directly analogous to the cover estimator of Canfield (1941).
- The six border segments of each hexagon sample six distinct directions (0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°), providing near-isotropic coverage of the landscape.

**Compositional-configurational divergence:**

$$\delta_i(t) = w_i(t) - A_i(t)$$

$\delta_i > 0$: interface more connected than interior composition suggests.  
$\delta_i < 0$: interface more degraded than interior composition suggests.  
$\delta_i = 0$: composition and interface connectivity aligned.

### 3.5 Annual time series construction
- EII and Area computed for all 40 years (1985–2024): two matrices of dimensions 11,500 cells × 40 years.

### 3.6 Temporal interval selection and sensitivity
- Primary analysis: annual resolution (1985–2024).
- Snapshot analysis: intervals anchored to documented deforestation regimes:
  - 1985 (baseline), 1995, 2004 (historical peak deforestation), 2012 (new Forest Code), 2020, 2024.
- Sensitivity test: comparison of results under 5-year vs. 10-year snapshot intervals.

### 3.7 Sensitivity to grid configuration (MAUP)

**3.7.1 Shape effect: hexagon vs. square**

Comparison structured across three explicit dimensions:

- **Dimension 1 — Aggregated distribution convergence:** 5×5 Area × EII matrices compared between HEX-20 and SQ-20. *Result (preliminary): maximum difference < 0.008 across all quadrants in both 1985 and 2020.*
- **Dimension 2 — Estimator variance per unit area:** CV of EII compared between HEX-20 and SQ-20. *Result (preliminary): CV_hex < CV_sq, consistent with hexagon's superior isoperimetric efficiency.*
- **Dimension 3 — Directional isotropy:** hexagon samples 6 × 60° directions; square samples 4 × 90° directions. Analytical argument — no additional empirical test required.

**3.7.2 Scale effect: multi-resolution comparison**
- EII and Area distributions compared across HEX-10, HEX-20, HEX-40.
- *Result (preliminary): mean EII differs by < 0.001 across scales in both 1985 and 2020; scale effect on aggregated distributions is negligible.*

**3.7.3 Zoning effect: systematic grid displacement**
- 25 realizations: 8 directions × 3 distances (1/6, 1/3, 1/2 of side length) + original.
- *Result (preliminary): mean EII varies by < 0.005 across 25 realizations; CV across realizations < 0.003. EII estimates are highly robust to grid placement.*

### 3.8 Change point detection
- Algorithm: PELT (Killick et al. 2012) applied independently to each cell's annual EII and Area series.
- Implementation: Python `ruptures` library; penalty parameter via BIC.
- Output: year(s) of structural break per cell for EII ($t^*_w$) and Area ($t^*_A$); temporal lag $\Delta_i = t^*_w - t^*_A$.

### 3.9 Spatial autocorrelation of divergence
- Global Moran's I computed annually on the binary divergence variable (Type I or Type II vs. coupled).
- Queen contiguity spatial weights, row-standardized; 99 permutations.
- Cumulative divergence trace: cells ever in divergent state across the full series.

### 3.10 Continuous divergence analysis (δ)
- Annual distribution of $\delta_i(t)$ across cells.
- Metrics: mean, median, SD, P10, P25, P75, P90; % cells with δ < 0, δ > 0, |δ| < 0.05.

---

## 4. Results

### 4.1 EII as a complementary information source (RQ1)
- Correlation between $A_i(t)$ and $w_i(t)$ across cells and time periods.
- Distribution of $\delta_i(t)$: % cells near zero, widening of distribution over time.
- Frequency of Type I and Type II states across the time series.
- *Preliminary result: in 1985, 75.8% of cells had |δ| < 0.05; by 2024, this fell to 58.5% — the domain became progressively more heterogeneous in the composition-configuration space.*

### 4.2 Compositional-configurational divergence dynamics (RQ2)
- Annual flux of the four landscape states (1985–2024).
- *Preliminary result: Coupled-High declined from 91.5% to 57.6%; total Type I + Type II increased from 2.5% to 8.4%.*
- Temporal trend of δ: cauda negativa (P10) widening from −0.061 to −0.093; % cells with δ < 0 increasing from 41.8% to 46.9%.
- Moran's I: *significant in all 40 years (p < 0.01); I ranging from 0.094 to 0.136 — divergent states are spatially clustered throughout the series.*
- Cumulative divergence trace: cells ever in Type I or Type II state across the full series.

### 4.3 Domain-scale dynamics — snapshot analysis (RQ2)
- 5×5 Area × EII frequency matrices for anchored snapshots.
- Difference matrices between periods.

### 4.4 Grid configuration sensitivity (RQ3)
- Shape: HEX-20 vs. SQ-20 — three-dimensional comparison (convergence, estimator variance, isotropy).
- Scale: HEX-10 / HEX-20 / HEX-40 — negligible effect on aggregated distributions.
- Jitter: mean EII range < 0.005 across 25 realizations; CV < 0.003.

### 4.5 Temporal interval sensitivity (RQ3)
- Comparison of 5-year vs. 10-year snapshot matrices.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 EII as a compositional-configurational divergence detector
- Area and EII measure different dimensions of landscape structure: composition (interior) and interface connectivity (boundary). Their divergence is not anomalous but informative.
- Type I cells (high area, low EII): interior habitat preserved but boundary isolation already advanced — potential matrix-surrounded remnants.
- Type II cells (low area, high EII): interior largely converted but still embedded in a connected matrix — landscapes in early-stage conversion.
- Both types increase over time and are spatially clustered (Moran's I > 0.09 throughout), confirming that divergence is not noise but a structured spatial signal associated with active transformation frontiers.

### 5.2 The δ signal and its ecological interpretation
- The negative tail of the δ distribution widens progressively — interface connectivity degrades faster than interior area in a growing fraction of cells.
- Hypothesis: edge-in conversion dynamics produce Type I states as the leading edge of fragmentation, before interior loss is detectable by area metrics.
- This positions EII as an early-configuration indicator complementary to area metrics.

### 5.3 MAUP reframed as sampling variance
- The grid as a sampling device: spatial uncertainty is quantifiable (CV < 0.003 across 25 jitter realizations) and ecologically interpretable.
- Regions of high jitter instability — if present — would locate abrupt landscape boundaries, not methodological artifacts.
- Hexagonal grids are preferable to square grids: lower estimator variance per unit area, greater directional isotropy.

### 5.4 Methodological scope and transferability
- Raster-agnostic: applicable to any binary habitat map at any resolution.
- Scalable: checkpoint-based pipeline processes 40 annual rasters in a single run.
- Limitations: EII measures perimeter-level connectivity, not functional connectivity; does not account for species-specific dispersal; requires hardcoded nodata handling when raster metadata encoding is ambiguous.

### 5.5 Connections to existing literature
- Relationship to composition/configuration distinction (McGarigal & Marks 1995): Area = composition estimator; EII = configuration estimator at interface level.
- Relationship to edge density metrics (FRAGSTATS): EII is boundary-referenced and cell-scale rather than patch-referenced and landscape-scale.
- Relationship to graph-based connectivity: EII weights ($w_{ij}$) can serve directly as edge weights in a spatial graph — future work.

---

## 6. Conclusions

- The Edge Interception Index, grounded in the line intercept sampling theory of vegetation ecology, provides an efficient and interpretable metric of landscape interface connectivity from any binary raster time series.
- Area and EII capture complementary dimensions — composition and interface connectivity — and their divergence characterizes landscape states that area metrics cannot distinguish.
- Applied to 40 years of habitat dynamics in central Brazil, EII reveals a progressive widening of compositional-configurational divergence, spatially structured along active transformation frontiers (Moran's I significant in all years).
- MAUP effects are quantifiable as sampling variance (CV < 0.003) and the method is robust across shape, scale, and placement choices.
