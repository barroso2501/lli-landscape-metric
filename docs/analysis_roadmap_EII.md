## Finalized configuration decisions

| Parameter | Decision |
|---|---|
| Study domain | Rectangle 1,500 × 1,500 km, ESRI:102033 (Albers Equal Area Conic) |
| Domain corners | SW (200,000; 1,700,000) m — NE (1,700,000; 3,200,000) m |
| Primary grid | Hexagonal, 20,000 ha (~8.8 km side; ~52.6 km perimeter; ~15.2 km flat-to-flat), 11,500 cells |
| Scale sensitivity | 10,000 ha (22,842 cells) / 20,000 ha / 40,000 ha (5,822 cells) |
| Shape sensitivity | Square, 20,000 ha (11,449 cells) |
| Border cells | None — all cells fully contained within rectangular domain |
| CRS | ESRI:102033 throughout |
| Nodata handling | nodata=255 hardcoded for both EII and Area (raster metadata declares nodata=0, which is valid non-natural vegetation data) |

## Overview

Four sequential phases. Phases 1 and 2 are complete. Phase 3 is in progress.
Complexity: 🟢 Low / 🟡 Medium / 🔴 High.

---

## Phase 1 — Grid Generation and Configuration ✅ COMPLETE

### 1.0 — Generate all grids ✅
- **Actual outputs:** hex_10000ha.shp (22,842 cells), hex_20000ha.shp (11,500 cells), hex_40000ha.shp (5,822 cells), sq_20000ha.shp (11,449 cells)
- **Tool used:** ArcGIS Pro — Generate Tessellation
- **CRS:** ESRI:102033

### 1.1 — Shape comparison: hexagon vs. square ✅
- **Actual result:** Maximum difference between HEX-20 and SQ-20 matrices < 0.008 in all quadrants (1985 and 2020). CV_hex ≈ CV_sq (difference < 0.001). Distributions practically identical at biome scale.
- **Conclusion:** Method robust to shape choice. Hexagonal grid preferred on theoretical grounds (isotropy) but not empirically necessary at this scale.

### 1.2 — Scale sensitivity ✅
- **Actual result:** Mean EII differs by < 0.001 across HEX-10, HEX-20, HEX-40 in both years. Scale effect on aggregated distributions is negligible within the tested range.
- **Conclusion:** HEX-20 confirmed as primary configuration. Results stable across scales.

### 1.3 — Jitter (zoning sensitivity) ✅
- **Design:** 25 realizations (8 directions × 3 distances + original); displacements: 2,533 / 5,066 / 7,598 m.
- **Actual result:** Mean EII range across 25 realizations < 0.005 in both years. CV across realizations < 0.003.
- **Conclusion:** EII estimates are highly robust to grid placement. Method passes MAUP test.

## Phase 2 — Full Annual Time Series ✅ COMPLETE

### 2.1 — Run EII and Area pipeline for all years ✅
- **Actual output:** eii_HEX20_annual.csv and area_HEX20_annual.csv — 11,500 cells × 40 years (1985–2024).
- **Key finding:** EII mean declined from 0.858 (1985) to 0.643 (2024); Area mean declined from 0.859 to 0.644.

### 2.2 — Assemble paired dataset and compute divergence metrics ✅
- **Actual outputs:** eii_area_HEX20_annual.csv, annual_states.csv, delta_annual_summary.csv, moran_annual.csv
- **Key results:**

**Annual state dynamics (1985 → 2024):**
| State | 1985 | 2024 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Concordant-High | 91.5% | 57.6% | −33.9 pp |
| Concordant-Low | 6.0% | 34.1% | +28.0 pp |
| Type I (high area, low EII) | 0.9% | 4.2% | +3.3 pp |
| Type II (low area, high EII) | 1.6% | 4.1% | +2.5 pp |
| Total divergent (I + II) | 2.5% | 8.4% | +5.8 pp |

**Delta (EII − Area) dynamics (1985 → 2024):**
| Metric | 1985 | 2024 |
|---|---|---|
| P10 (negative tail) | −0.061 | −0.093 |
| SD | 0.054 | 0.076 |
| % cells with δ < 0 | 41.8% | 46.9% |
| % cells with |δ| < 0.05 | 75.8% | 58.5% |

**Moran's I (divergent states):** p ≤ 0.01 in all 40 years (99 permutations; 0.01 is the minimum attainable pseudo p-value); I = 0.094–0.136; z-scores 16–26. Divergent cells are spatially clustered throughout the series.
